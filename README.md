# React with Webpack & Babel
Everything we need for a solid foundation to build pretty much anything with the latest ES6 javascript - making it even easier to transition from java to js.


 - [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) 
   - build component-based interfaces 
 - [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)
   - a simple module bundler, and so much more   
 - [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) 
   - write ES6 compliant code, and it's transpiled into a script that runs in today's browsers  


### To run

* You'll need to have [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed in your system.
install the dependencies:

```
> $ npm install
```

Install webpack and the development server:

```
> $ npm i webpack-dev-server webpack -g
```

You can simply run webpack build using this command: 

```
> $ npm run build
```

If you want to run with webpack-dev-server simply run this command: 

```
> $ npm run dev
```

Open the web browser to `http://localhost:1337/`
